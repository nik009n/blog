 This is a simple blog built using django, where people can sign up, make blog posts add comments,create new categories and like posts. It also allows users to customize their profiles with profile photos, biography etc. This blog will allow users to access all these functionalities only if they are logged in. It has logic applied to make sure users can only modify, edit and delete their own posts, profiles and also make blog posts and add comments only on their own behalf. Also it has a super user who has all the functionality you'd expect from an administrator.
